# -Basic-Item-based-Recommendation-System-
This notebook demonstrates the development of a basic recommendation system using Python and pandas. The focus is on recommending items that are most similar to a given item by leveraging item similarity.

Objectives:

->Build a Basic Recommendation System: Implement a system to suggest items based on similarity.
->Calculate Item Similarity: Use the corrwith() method to compute correlations between items.
->Sort and Recommend: Sort the DataFrame by correlation to identify and recommend the most similar items.

Workflow:

1.Data Preparation:
Load the dataset containing user ratings for various items.
Merge item metadata (e.g., movie titles) with the ratings data.

2.Similarity Calculation:
Use pandas' corrwith() method to calculate the correlation between items based on user ratings.

3.Recommendation:
Sort items by their similarity scores.
Provide recommendations based on the most similar items.
